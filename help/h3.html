<h2><strong>Maintenance</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <a name=ah24><strong>ADIF import</strong></a><br><br>
    The main purpose is to add QSO records from other logging and/or contesting programs.
    You may need it if you migrate from another logger or if you are adding contacts made
    in a contest (any modern contesting program has the ADIF export facility, some older
    programs may need a third party conversion utility).
    <br><br>
    Cqrlog now follows ADIF 3.1.0 specification of special UTF8 characters. Mainly they can be found from Name, QTH, Comment and Notes fields. Specification says that when there is special character(s) some adif tags may have suffix _INTL to show this. Like &lt;QTH_INTL:6&gt;Pyhtää
    <br>If pure ASCII charcters are found the usual tag format is used. Like &lt;QTH:4&gt;Pori
    <br>Every time special UTF8 character is found in tags, where specification allows, UTF8 printing routines are used and the _INTL suffix is added.
    <br>At import side tags with suffix _INTL are read with UTF8 routines. Without _INTL with normal ASCII routines. This makes importing backward compatible with old cqrlog exports that have set tag lenght wrong if there has been special UTF8 characters in tag data.<br><br>
    Go to QSO list (Ctrl+O on the main logging screen or File -> Show QSO list from the menu).
    <br><br>
    <img src="img/h39.png" border="0"><br><br>
    From the menu <strong>here</strong> choose File -> Import -> ADIF.<br><br>
    Click on 'ADIF' and an 'Open file' dialog appears.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h40.png" border="0"><br><br>Navigate to the file you want to import and
    click 'Open'. You will see a new dialog, click the 'Import' button here. You can also
    add a QTH profile and a note ('Comment to QSO(s):') which will appear on every imported QSO record.
    Using this option, a portable, mobile or QRP operation can be clearly marked.
    <br>
    You can also filter by date range of adif file records. Checking "No check for duplicates" and "ADIF file contains..." may speed up big ADIF imports.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h41.png" border="0"><br><br>
    If you import a huge file, you will see a progress bar, however import of a small file
    is so fast that you never notice the progress indicator.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h42.png" border="0"><br><br>
    The previous window now shows the import completion, the number of imported records and
    the number of errors. If the ADIF file contains incorrect entries, they will be stored
    separately in the file <strong>errors.adi</strong> located in the 'log_data' subfolder.
    You can fix the errors manually and import again. <br><br>
    <img src="img/h43.png" border="0"><br><br>
    Duplicate entries (contacts already in the log) are indicated with a separate dialog
    allowing you to exclude or include these records.
    <p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
    <a name=ah25><strong>ADIF export</strong></a><br><br>
    Go to QSO list using Ctrl-O or choose the QSO list from the upper menu - item 'File'.<br><br>
    <img src=img/h39.png><br><br>
    From the QSO list, choose 'Export' in the menu - item 'File'.<br><br>
    <img src=img/h45.png><br><br>
    Choose 'ADIF'. An usual a dialog appears (depending on the desktop used). Choose a
    location and file name.<br><br>
    <img src=img/h45b.png><br><br>
    <img src=img/h45c.png><br><br>
    When <b>OK</b> is pressed export begins.<br><br>
    <p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
    <a name=ah26><strong>HTML export</strong></a><br><br>
    The same as above, only difference is to set column names and widths (in character counts). Note that contest Nr and Msg column names will get "R" or "S" added as last letter of column name.
    <br><br>
    <img src=img/h45d.png><br><br>
    If "HTML auto size columns" is checked width setting is ignored and column width is set by longest text (in header or data).
    <br><br>
    <img src=img/h45e.png><br><br>
    Choose the 'HTML' option from QSO list Export menu.<br><br>
    <p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
    <p><a name=ah27><strong>Program version update:</strong></a><br><br>
    Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10, 18.04 users can use CQRLOG’s repository on Launchpad. To add repository to your system, put into terminal this:<br/>
    <br>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ok2cqr/ppa;sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install cqrlog<br>
    <br>For those who does not use Ubuntu, load install package, or binaries, from: Cqrlog.com <a href="https://www.cqrlog.com/download" target="_new"> download page.</a><br>
    <br>The binaries should work in any distribution. Please don't forget to install MySQL server, MySQL client, Hamlib libraries and if LoTW support is desired, trustedqsl package and libssl-devel must be installed.</p>

If your package manager does not support latest version and you have well running old version in use just copy folder ~/.config/cqrlog with all files and subfolders to safe place as backup. Copy also 
                /usr/bin/cqrlog to same place. Then download the tgz file "Complete application directory for other distributions", extract file /usr/bin/cqrlog from there and copy it to your /usr/bin folder (you need to use root priveleges I.E sudo for that).
                If everything works you have latest version. If not, just copy back your saved folder ~/.config/cqrlog and the old /usr/bin/cqrlog.

    <a name=ah28><strong>How to update Country files:</strong></a><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Unpack and copy all the files into the /ctyfiles folder in your CQRLOG main folder.
            The purpose of this folder is to store these files only, it is not bound to CQRLOG and
            does not affect its function.
        </li>
        <li>Start CQRLOG and select the 'Show QSO list' from the 'File' item in the main menu.
            You can also get there using shortcut Ctrl-O.
        </li>
        <li>If you are already in the QSO list, go to menu. Click the 'File' item, then the 'Import'
            option. Choose the DXCC data option, located at lowest position. A dialog appears,
            navigate to your /ctyfiles folder. Click the 'Open' button. All files are read and if
            the import completes, a small window with the message 'Import complete. Please restart
            program' appears. Click the OK button and quit CQRLOG.
        </li>
        <li>Restart CQRLOG. The update is finished.</li>

    <a name=ah29><strong>QSL Manager Database update</strong></a><br><br>
    Since version 0.8.0 CQRLOG uses its own QSL Manager database in a very simple, plain
    text format (CSV, semicolon separated). The update is very simple. The automated update
    checks the availability of a new version, downloads and unpacks the tar.gz file if
    available. The new version must be imported - go to QSO list (Ctrl+O or from menu
    <em>File -> Show QSO list</em>) and choose the <em>File -> Import -> Import
    qsl managers database</em>.<br><br>
    A manual update is also possible if you download a recent version from the CQRLOG site
    <a href=http://www.cqrlog.com target="_new"><strong>http://www.cqrlog.com</strong></a>.<br><br>
    <img src=img/h107.png><br><br>
    The QSL Manager database format is as follows:<br>
<pre>
call;qsl_manager;publishing_date
Example:
3D2BV;JA1PBV;2008-01
</pre>
    You can maintain your own records but we carefully maintain this database with verified
    records from reliable sources (DX Bulletins). The database is updated monthly and the
    covered timespan of QSL Managers is limited to 10 years after publishing date. After
    this time, the expired records will be removed and stored in another file (archive)
    which will be available on the CQRLOG site
    <a href=http://www.cqrlog.com><strong>http://www.cqrlog.com</strong></a>.<br><br>
    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">

            <td style="width: 100%; text-align: justify; background-color: rgb(204, 255, 255);">
                <strong><font color="blue">Note:</font></strong> Because the HamQTH.com/QRZ.COM entries very often
                contain details useful for direct lookup but not suitable to print on QSL labels,
                choose the option <em>'Ignore HamQTH.com/QRZ.COM qsl info'</em> in the <em>Preferences ->
                New QSO</em> dialog.

    If a station has more than one QSL Manager, click the small button to the left of the

    <img src=img/h106.png><br><br>
    A popup window of selections appears:<br><br>
    <img src=img/h105.png><br><br>
    Navigate to the appropriate QSL manager, use the publishing date column or verify the
    QSL manager from another source. This ensures that the QSL label will contain the
    proper QSL manager.

    <a name=ah30><strong>Statistics rebuilding</strong></a><br><br>

    The only way to rebuild your statistics is <strong>from the QSO list</strong>.
    The 'Statistics' menu item has the 'Rebuild DXCC statistics' option (the similar option
    on the logging screen does NOT have a 'Rebuild' option).<br><br>

    <a name=ah31><strong>Membership databases</strong></a><br><br>
    CQRLOG supports online tracking of up to 5 memberships simultaneously. The membership
    databases can also be used for filter creation, along with a date span (from-to).
    The tracking and filtering feature is not limited to membership, you can create your
    own databases using lists of your particular interests (short-term awards, local
    groups etc.). The databases have a pure text format with data columns separated by
    a semicolon ';'.<br><br>
    The default installation contains data of some 57 clubs: AFM, AGCW, ARKTIKA, A1-CLUB,
    A1-OP, CAV, CCT, CFO, CFT, CONVENIAT, CTC, CWJF, CWSP, DIG, DTC, EHSC, EPC, FFR, FIRAC,
    FISTS, FMC, FOC, GACW, GQRPC, HACWG, HHC, HH, HSC, HTC, JAIG, MARCONISTA, MCL, MFCA,
    MF, OKDXC, OKDXF, OTC-SARA, PRC, PRL, QCWA, RAFARS, RIA, RNARS, RRDXA, RTC, SHSC, SKCC,
    SPAR, SPDXC, TEN-TEN, TFC, UDXC, UFT, VHSC, VRK, WAP, 070-CLUB, 9ACWG.
    <br>You can go to<br>
    <pre>/home/~/.config/cqrlog/members</pre>
    (the tilde ~ represents the name of your personal subdirectory within the 'home' folder).
    <br><br>
    Any membership file also contains a header consisting of two lines:
<pre>HSC
High Speed Club</pre>
    where the first line represents the <strong>short</strong> name of the club and the second
    line is the long <strong>club</strong> name. Both names must be in the header on separate
    lines. The first line must be the same as the filename without suffix, ie. the HSC
    membership list <strong>must</strong> be
    <pre>hsc.txt</pre>
    The mandatory suffix is
    <strong>.txt</strong> and the filename must be in <strong>lowercase</strong>.<br><br>
    You can examine the syntax which is more descriptive than this short example,
    however there are basically 3 types of membership list files:<br><br>
    <strong>1. Simple list of call signs.</strong> It does not contain any membership
    number or date limits. Syntax:<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;W5LGY<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;W5LJT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;W5LKL<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;W5LP<br><br>
    ie. a <strong>single</strong> call per line.<br><br>
    <strong>2. List of call signs with membership numbers.</strong> Syntax:<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DL5JAN;4603<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DL5JBM;4746<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DL5JBN;4642<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DL5JBW;5740<br><br>
    ie. a <strong>single</strong> call and membership number per line. The call and the
    membership number are separated by a semicolon ';'.<br><br>
    <strong>3. List of call signs with membership numbers and date limits.</strong>Used
    for short term awards or time span limited memberships. Syntax:<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;6O2NG;533;1957-04;2005-03<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;6Y5SR;868;1966-03;1982-07<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;6Y5XG;331;1951-05;-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;7J1AEF;1297;1976-06;-<br><br>
    ie. a <strong>single</strong> call, membership number and datelimits from-to, separated by
    a semicolon ';', per line. See above the two optins: 6O2NG with membership number 533 was
    a member of the club from April, 1957 to March, 2005. 6Y5XG with number 331 started his
    membership May, 1951 and is still a member. The dash instead of a date (separated from
    the begin date by a semicolon) denotes that the membership is still active. A dash can
    be used <strong>only</strong> in the field for 'to'.<br><br>

    Backup this directory, however it is big. If you want to save space, export your log into
    an ADIF file which is about half the size of the database directory. ADIF is also version
