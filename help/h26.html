            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<h2><strong>CW interface</strong></h2>
    Assuming that your CW interface is properly set up and working,
    you can add and/or edit your CW messages.<br><br>
    First, set up your CW messages. In the upper menu bar on the logging screen,
    click on the 'File' item.<br><br>
    <img src=img/h96.png><br><br>
    Choose the 'CW Messages' option. In the resulting window, edit your CW messages which
    will be played if you press the corresponding F key (in the logging screen).
    You can set up to 10 predefined messages:<br><br>
    <img src=img/h97.png><br><br>
    There are some predefined macros which you can use in your messages:<br><br>

		<li>%rs - rst send sends N instead of 9<br>(sends also 0 as T, but that does not exist in normal report)</li>

		<li>%xn  - contest exchenge serial number</li>
		<li>%xm  - contest exchange message</li>
		<li>%xns - contest exchenge serial number sends 9->N and 0->T</li>
		<li>%xrs - full contest exchange RST+SerialNR+Message sends 9->N and 0->T.<br>
		(May be used always instead of %rs as if serNR and Message are empty just sends plain report.)</li>

   <br/>CW keys from has new buttons PgUp and PgDn that are not configurable. They alter CW speed in same way as keyboard keys PgUp and PgDn that some, specially laptop computers, do not have.</p>
   <p>When using external keyboard, and CW keys-form with mouse, you always have to first focus NewQso-form to be active and then press PgUp / PgDn keys. Now you can do it from same focused CW-keys form that you launch memories with mouse.</p>

    Another option 'CW type' is a powerful keyboard keyer with 3 operation modes:<br><br>
    <img src=img/h98.png><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>letter mode</strong> - the character of the corresponding keyboard key is
            sent immediately on pressing the key
        <li><strong>word mode</strong> - a whole word is typed, sending starts after pressing
            of the spacebar
        <li><strong>word mode, first word in letter mode</strong> - a combination of above.
            The keyer begins in letter mode to avoid unneccessary delays, if you type fast enough
            it switches to word mode
        </li>
    </ul>
    These modes are common on professional keyboard keyers.<br><br>
    CWTyping area allows paste (copy in editor/paste to CWType) and drop (select in editor and drag with mouse left button pressed and drop on CWType area).<br><br>
    <strong>NOTE!</strong> CW sending has limited buffer space depending keyer type and rig model(if Hamlib keying is in use). There is no feedback from buffer
     overflow so do not paste/drop long texts to CWTyping area. With Icom rigs and HamLib keying buffer overflow will stop cw message sending indicating that operator should check the length of message.
      This is tested to work with IC7300. Same should happen with Kenwood rigs and HamLib keying, but this is not tested and may not work in same way.
      <br> Other keyers may indicate buffer overflow in different ways.
      <br><br> <strong>Same warning  </strong>with manual typing in word mode: If your typing speed is faster than cw sending you may hit send buffer limit at some moment.<br><br>
    The <strong>keying speed</strong> can be changed with PgUp (QRQ) and PgDn (QRS) keys
    in 2 WPM steps when NewQSO window is active. In the 'CW type' window when cursor is in text typing area same PgUP/PgDN keys work. Speed can also be changed with the small arrow
    buttons to the right of the speed display. The actual speed is always displayed in the status line of the logging screen and in CWType windows speed selector.<br><br>
    The<strong> ESC </strong>key stops running transmit. This may not be supported in all keyers and rigs and is mainly usefull when using word mode or pasted/dropped text.<br><br>
    <strong>NOTE!</strong> Some special characters like Ã„ (A with dots) etc. May not be supported in CWType direct from keypress. For example Hamlib keying with Icom rig sends A with dots when typing 3 characters ^AA and you have to find out the way suitable for your setup.<br><br>
