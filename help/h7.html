            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<div align=left><strong>CQRLOG for LINUX by OK7AN &amp; OK1RR</strong></div>
<p align="center"><img src="img/line.png"></p><a name="bh4"></a><br><b><h2>LoTW support</h2></b>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<div align=justify>We assume that you have a working LoTW Account. If you are new to LoTW,
    carefully read the instructions provided by the ARRL and set up your account.<br><br>
    Most important is the certificate. ARRL issues certificates (.tq8) which are bound to
    a particular machine and cannot be transferred to another place. If you receive a
    .tq8 certificate, it is <b>absolutely essential to convert it to more usual .p12</b>
    format which <strong>can</strong> be transferred. Do this immediately!<br><br>
    Download and install the latest LoTW utilities (<em>tqsl</em> and <em>tqslcert</em>).
    <p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
    <img src="img/h76.png"><br><br>
    <div align=justify>If you didn't do it already in the 'Preferences' setup procedure,
        provide your user name for LoTW and the password (this is <strong>not</strong> the
        password sent to US amateurs via postcard!).<br><br>
        Now you need to select a certificate corresponding to the QTH you used while making
        the QSOs you want to confirm. Check the certificates available by opening tqslcert
        which displays all certificates.
    </div>
    <br>
    <img src="img/h78.png"><br><br>
    <div align=justify>Now select the proper certificate <strong><em>in tqsl</em></strong>.
        If you only have a single certificate, you don't need to make any selection, however note
        the name of the QTH which must be entered into CQRLOG.
    </div>
    <br>
    <img src="img/h79.png"><br><br>
    <img src="img/h80.png"><br><br>
    <div align=justify>The QTH profile name here is 'Praha'. The callsign is added by default
        however only the name (here 'Praha') should be entered into <em>tqsl command line
            arguments:</em> column of the <em>QSL->LoTW->Export->Upload to LoTW</em> window.
    </div>
    <br>
    <img src="img/h81.png"><br><br>
    <div align=justify>Once entered, the QTH name stays in the predefined command line.</div>
    <p><strong>LoTW file export and upload</strong></p>
    <div align=justify><strong>1. Select the QSO records</strong> you want to confirm.

        A suitable choice is a filter for date, QSL received etc.<br><br>
        Now, there are two possibilities:
        <blockquote>
            <strong>I. Export the selected records</strong> to a local ADIF file. This is useful
            if you don't want (or it is impossible) to upload your log to LoTW.
            Go to <em>QSL->LoTW->Export->Export QSOs to LoTW adif file</em><br><br>
            <img src="img/h82.png"><br><br>
            <div align=justify>Provide a file name in the <em>Export to:</em> field.</div>
            <br>
            <img src="img/h83.png"><br><br>
            <div align=justify>If you want to mark the exported QSO records, do it now. Click
                the <em>Export</em> button and go to <em>Upload to LoTW menu</em> item. The ADIF file
                can be signed and uploaded later.<br><br>The other option is export, signing and upload
                your log to LoTW in a single step.<br><br>
                <strong>II. export, signing and upload your log to LoTW from CQRLOG</strong><br><br>
                Go to Upload to LoTW dialog and choose the QSO records which should be exported:
            </div>
            <br>
            <img src="img/h84.png"><br><br>
            <div align=justify>Click the <em>Export & sign</em> button. You should see:<br>
<pre>Signing adif file ...
Signed ...
If you did not see any errors, you can send signed file to LoTW
website by pressing the Upload button</pre>
                <br>
                Now click the <em>Upload</em> button. A message<br>
<pre>Uploading file ...
Size: xxxxx
Uploading was succesful<br></pre>
        </blockquote>
        This procedure can be checked in the following way: in the /cqrlog/lotw folder there should
        appear two new files - an ADIF file named date_time.adi (where date and time corresponding
        to the date and time of creation) and the signed file with the same file name but .tq8
        extension which is then uploaded to the LoTW site. Finally, you can check the
        <a href=https://p1k.arrl.org/lotwuser/default><strong>LoTW site</strong></a>.
        Log in and go to <em>Your Account -> Your Activity</em> and you should see your last
        upload with the date, time and file name.
        <br><br></div>
    <p><strong>LoTW files download and processing</strong></p>
    <div align=justify>The main purpose of the LoTW file processing (also download) is to
        mark existing QSO records as confirmed via LoTW. Files can be downloaded directly
        into CQRLOG or an already downloaded ADIF files can be processed.
    </div>
    <br>
    <img src="img/h85.png"><br><br>
    <div align=justify>Both options are shown here. If the <em>Import local LoTW ADIF
        file</em> (already downloaded from the LoTW site) is processed, a simple progress
        indicator is shown.
    </div>
    <br>
    <img src="img/h86.png"><br><br>
    If you choose <em>Download and process data from LoTW website</em> a progress
    indicator is displayed.
</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/h87.png"><br><br>
<div align=justify>The Size changes while downloading, if finished it indicates the
    total file size. When the download finishes, a summary appears and the import begins,
    showing the same progress indicator as above.
</div>
<br>
<img src="img/h88.png"><br><br>
If the file is not accessible (due to server overload etc.), an error message is shown.
Also if the file contains a record which is not in your log, a warning message appears.
