            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<a name="ah23"><h2><strong>Statistics</strong></h2></a>
There are 4 basic types of online statistics:
<ul>
    <li>DXCC</li>
    <li>WAZ zones</li>
    <li>ITU zones</li>
    <li>IOTA</li>
</ul>
<p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
<strong>DXCC</strong><br><br>
The statistics can be viewed from both the login screen and the QSO list, however the menu
is slightly different. While the logging screen only allows viewing the statistics,
the QSO list can trigger a DXCC statistics rebuild.
<table cellspacing="2" border="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Logging screen</strong></td>
        <td><strong>QSO List</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img src="img/h20.png" border="0">
        <td valign="top">
            <img src="img/h46.png"></td>
        </td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
The main difference is that the 'Details' window can ionly be activated (if not activated
at program startup, <a href="h1.html#ah4"><strong>see 'Preferences'</strong></a>)
from the logging screen.
Statistics <a href="h3.html#ah30"><strong>rebuilding</strong></a> is only possible
from the QSO list.<br><br>
The only statistics which should be maintained are the DXCC ones. With the exception of
the footer of the DXCC detailed presentation, all DXCC scores are based on actual valid
contries on the current DXCC list, ie. <strong>NO</strong> deleted countries. Other
stats are computed while logging.<br><br>
There are several presentations of DXCC statistics. A summary is displayed in the
QSO List, just above the table.<br>
<img src="img/h56.png" border="0"><br><br>
The detailed statistics are displayed from the logging screen by clicking on the
'Statistics' item of the upper menu bar.<br>
<img src="img/h57.png" border="0"><br>
The 'X' denotes a worked country, the 'Q' a confirmed country, the 'L' a confirmed country by LOTW
and the 'E' a confirmed country by eQSL.<br>
The order is <strong>PHONE - CW - DIGI</strong>. The example above shows, that Rodrigues,
3B9, has been worked on 30 metres CW only, on 20 and 17 metres CW and SSB and on 15 metres
CW, SSB and digital modes.<br><br>
<img src="img/h58.png" border="0"><br>
The summary footer shows your actual score band by band on all modes, worked and
confirmed separately. The 'Totals' column shows your band point score per DXCC
Challenge rules. The framed counts showing <strong>ALL TIME DXCC scores</strong>
with deleted countries. It is the only instance showing this.<br><br>
The 'Export to HTML' button allows exporting of your whole statistics into a nicely
formatted HTML page. This is an exact copy of the detailed DXCC stats presentation,
including the footer with all-time scores.
<p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
<strong>WAZ and ITU Zones</strong><br><br>
Both statistics are similar and very simple.<br><br>
<img src="img/h59.png" border="0"><br><br>
Again, the 'X' denotes worked, the 'Q' confirmed, the footer contains totals of worked
and confirmed zones, band by band.
<p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
<strong>IOTA</strong><br><br>
<img src="img/h60.png" border="0">
<br><br>
The IOTA statistics presentation is slightly different. An IOTA reference number and
the station worked (confirmed) is displayed. These statistics are derived from the IOTA
records of each logged contact. If a QSO record does not contain IOTA information but
the station <strong>is</strong> valid for IOTA, the statistics do not reflect this fact.
So update regularly!<br><br>
The small check box in the left lower corner toggles the worked/confirmed scores.
The 'Save' button exports the statistics to an ASCII text file.
