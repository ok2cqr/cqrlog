            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<a name=co1><h2><strong>Contest support</strong></h2></a>
<p>You will find contest selection from <b>NewQSO/Window</b> dropdown menu.
<br><br>When contest window is open <b>NewQSO</b> has contest exchange fields visible. You may have to stretch <b>NewQSO </b> window horizontally to see them.
<br>You <b>do not</b> normally need <b>NewQSO</b> window during contest. Only need for <b>NewQSO</b> is in case you have to edit an already worked qso.
 <br> Select qso normally via <b>QSO list</b> and press <b>edit QSO button</b> and you are able to edit qso, also the contest message part of it.
 <br><br><b>NewQSO</b>  is not meant to be used during contest qso feeds. <b>All new qsos are entered via contest window.</b></p>

<p align="center">
   <img src="img/contest.png">
</p>
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> Make new log for each contest, consider not to allow qrz/hamqth search, it may slow down qso feed.
<b>Note:</b> This is <b>NOT</b> a contest logging add-on!!! It is a contest-notepad.
It is meant to be a tool for "Sunday contesters working in Tourist Class". Do not expect wonders!
</p><p>
Contest window is just a "child form" for <b>NewQSO</b> to make qso logging faster when working in contests.
With <b>Tru</b> and <b>Msg is Loc</b> setting it is useful also in VHF, UHF, SHF Tropo, Es etc. openings for fast qso
logging. Perhaps also in some other operations like WWFF activations.
<br><br>
Contest window has a simple dupe check that turns typed duplicate callsign bold red printed. If you save a duplicate qso it is marked as "Dupe" in "Comment to qso" field.
<br>To get this working properly you must <b>either</b> create a new log for every contest <b>or</b> set "preferences/fldigi/wsjt interface/
<b>WB4 check starts from/call Date</b>" and check the <b>"call" checkbox</b>. See :  <a href="h1.html#ch2b">Quick start: wsjt-x interface</a> Remember to uncheck "call" checkbox after contest is over.
</p>
<p>
<b>HOTKEYS</b> work like with <a href="h20.html">New QSO window</a>.
<ul><li> <b>2x ESC</b> clears all fileds</li>
<li>Note: <b>1x ESC</b> returns cursor back to Call-field (if cursor is in some of the other fields like RSTr) and places cursor at the end of callsign for possible repairs.<br>
  It also halts CW memory output if it is just running.</li>
<li> <b> F1..F10 </b>send CW macros etc.</li>
<li> <b>TAB-key</b> moves cursor between fields. (may also be SPACE key, if set) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Contest window has following fields and checkboxes:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Tab All</b> when checked overrides all other Tab settings (below) and Tab Order is Call-RSTs-NRs-MSGs-RSTr-NRr-MSGr-SaveQSO-ClearAll</li>
<li><b>Call</b> when you leave this field callsign is moved to NewQSO. Callsign turns BOLD RED if it is duplicate.</li>
<li><b>SPACE is TAB</b> when checked space bar acts like TAB-key moving to next field. <b>Note:</b>This prevents typing space (perhaps needed in MSG fields).</li>
<li><b>NoMode4Dupe</b> Default checked. Means that callsign is duplicate if it is worked on that band in any mode. There are contests where you can work same station again on same band if mode is different (separate CW,SBB,RTTY sections). In that case uncheck this checkbox.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>RST s</b> copied from NewQSO, so should correspond used mode. Can be changed.</li>
<li><b>Tru</b> means you like to exchange true reports. Makes Tab order to stop at RST (s & r) fields. Useful in some high band contests, Es and tropo openings.</li>
<br>
<li><b>NR s</b> serial number to send. <b>Note:</b> you can type only numbers to NR s field.</li>
<li> <b>Inc</b> if checked it will auto increment serial number. You may change this number at any time. Increment goes on from typed number.</li>
<br>
<li><b>MSG s</b> sometimes you may need an additional message with number, or just a message with no number. On high band contests you may type your locator here.</li>
<li><b>Qsp</b> if checked makes TAB order stop at MSG s. Content of MSG s is taken from last logged MSG r. Cursor is placed at the end of message for possible edit. For contests where you have circulating message: At 1st qso you set your own word to send, after that you send previously received word as your next own message. </li>
<br>
<li><b>RST r</b> copied from NewQSO, so should correspond used mode. Can be changed.</li>
<br>
<li><b>NR r</b> serial number you receive. <b>Note:</b> you can type only numbers to NR r field. </li>
<li><b>No </b> if no serial number then setting this changes tab order so that it jumps directly to MSG r. </li>
<br>
<li><b>MSG r</b> message you receive</li>
<li> <b>MSG is LOC</b> if checked then message will be logged <b>ALSO</b> as locator grid <b>AND</b> SRX String</li>
<br>
<li><b>Save QSO</b> Save QSO button at NewQSO, increments NR and clears all fields. <b>Note:</b> pressing <b>ENTER at any time</b> after Call field is filled does the same.</li>
<li><b>Clear all</b> Clear all fields.  <b>Note:</b> Pressing 2x ESC key does the same.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Typical contest qso goes like this:</b><br>
Type callsign-&gt;press TAB-&gt;type contest rxnumber-&gt;press TAB-&gt;type contest message-&gt;press ENTER.
Or hit ENTER after rxnumber if no additional message is exchanged.
</p>
<p>Remember that pressing <b>ENTER</b> key at any field saves qso with existing values. How ever there must be
callsign of least three characters long. Sent/Received number and message are not needed.
<br><b>There is no need to use the mouse.</b> Keep your hands on keyboard (and possible on CW key / PTT (if not foot pedal in use)). It is faster.</p>
<p>
Contest numbers and messages are saved in log into their own columns. Use <b>preferences/Visible columns</b> to show them in <b>Qso list</b>.
<br><br>
<b>CW macros</b> can be used for sending contest meessages. Look them from help section <a href="h26.html">CW Operation</a>
</p>
<p>
ADIF exports fields to right tags.<br><br>
&lt;RST_SENT:3&gt;599&lt;STX:3&gt;001<br>
&lt;RST_RCVD:3&gt;599&lt;SRX:3&gt;002<br>
&lt;RST_SENT:3&gt;599&lt;STX:3&gt;003&lt;STX_STRING:2&gt;SA<br>
&lt;RST_RCVD:3&gt;599&lt;SRX:3&gt;003&lt;SRX_STRING:2&gt;dd<br>
&lt;RST_SENT:3&gt;599&lt;STX:3&gt;002&lt;STX_STRING:2&gt;SA<br>
&lt;RST_RCVD:3&gt;599&lt;SRX:3&gt;003&lt;SRX_STRING:2&gt;kb<br>
&lt;RST_SENT:3&gt;599&lt;STX:3&gt;001&lt;STX_STRING:2&gt;SA<br>
&lt;RST_RCVD:3&gt;599&lt;SRX:3&gt;002&lt;SRX_STRING:2&gt;SB<br>
</p>
<p>
HTML export will look like this:<br>

</br>
Most contests expect <b>Cabrillo</b> log format. Cqrlog has a limited support of Cabrillo exports. Mostly enough for a Sunday contester.
<br>In case you want to use external Cabrillo program you have to make ADIF export of qsos</b>
and then use another program.</p><p>
</br>
I found nice <b>adif2cabrillo</b> program for Linux from <a href="http://users.telenet.be/on4qz/a2c/index.html" target="_blank">http://users.telenet.be/on4qz/</a> that supports ADIF importing.
</p></p>Starting is bit complicated: 
</br>You need to compile it from source. Qt5 with qmake (called qmake-qt5 if your distro is Fedora) is needed to be able to compile
it.</br>
Then there are no templates for different contests. You have to create them, but after that it serves you well!
It accepts nicely exported ADIF format from cqrlog and dig out STX and SRX as expected.
