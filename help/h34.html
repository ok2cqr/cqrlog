            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<p><h3>Preparation</h3></p>
<div align=justify>We assume that you have a working eQSL Account. If you are new to eQSL,
    carefully read the instructions provided by the eQSL and set up your account.<br>
    Most important is to set the QTH nickname and dates to validate qsos with that name.
    </p><p><h3>Setup</h3></p>
    <div align=justify>If you didn't do it already in the <a href="h1.html#bh4"<strong>Preferences</strong></a> setup procedure,
        provide your user name for eQSL and the password.
    </div>
    </p>

    <br><h3>eQSL upload</h3></p>
    <p>
    You find eQSL up and donwload from <b>QSO list/QSL</b> menu.<br>
    <div align=justify><strong>Select the QSO records</strong> you want to confirm.
    Either whole log, or just files that have never been uploaded (that is the normal operation).
    <br>Be sure that<b> QTH Nickname </b> is the same you defined at eQSL website setup.
   <br>Now click the <b>Upload</b> button. A message will appear to inform you about ulpload progress.<br>

    </p>

    <p><h3>eQSL download and processing</h3></p>
    <p><div align=justify>The main purpose of the eQSL  download is to
        mark existing QSO records as confirmed via eQSL.
    </div>
    <br>
    <img src="img/eqsl2.png"><br><br>
    Set the <b>date after</b> to request QSL records. This is normally good to keep in current year for daily use.
    It keep the download and porcessing fast. Every now and then set te date more back to past to see possible late confirms.
    <br>Be sure that<b> QTH Nickname </b> is the same you defined at eQSL website setup.
    If you press <b>Download  data from eQSL website</b> a progress
    indicator is displayed in <b>Progress</b> window.
