            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<a name="ah17"><h2><strong>New QSO (online logging)</strong></h2></a>

    While logging online (during your QSO), date, start and end time are
    set automatically. Type the call into the dedicated box and move from
    this field with <strong>Arrow-Down</strong> key or <strong>spacebar</strong>
    (only if you enable it in the <a href="h1.html#ah4"><strong>Preferences</strong></a>).
    The 'Frequency' and 'Mode' fields are skipped if you have properly set up the
    <a href="h1.html#ah7"><strong>TRX Control</strong></a>.
    If you omit settting up the TRX Control option or if your radio does not
    allow Computer Aided Control (CAT), the Frequency and Mode fields
    are not skipped and must be filled manually, however you can use the
    pull-down menu to choose a corresponding default frequency in any band
    and the mode. <br><br>
    When the cursor leaves the 'Call' field, you will see your previous
    contacts with the logged station (if any). The number above 'Call' box marked 'QSO nr.'
    denotes the number of contacts you already have with the worked station (here,
    130 QSO worked already with G3LIK, the 131st just being logged). The previously confirmed
    contacts are highlighted in red. If the station has a QSL
    manager, his call appears in the 'QSL VIA' field and an indication
    'QSL manager found' is displayed. If the station wants QSL direct only,
    the 'QSL VIA' field remains empty but the red 'QSL manager found'
    warning is still displayed. Click the button at the right of the
    'QSL VIA' field and a separate window with QSL managers appears, the
    correct address is highlighted.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h29.png" border="0"><br><br>
    Note, that if you move the cursor from the 'Call' field to the 'RST
    sent' field, the S in the RST is highlighted, making it possible to simply
    overwrite the corresponding number (S). The same applies to the 'RST rcvd'
    field.<br><br>
    This trick can speed up the QSO entering procedure. You can also move
    between fields with the TAB key but then the whole RST field is highlighted, so
    reports where more than a single character need to be overwritten (ie.
    449) can be entered more easily. The default report
    is predefined in <a href="h1.html#ah4"><strong>Preferences</strong></a>).
    Note, the RST field changes to its correct form (RS or RST) with mode.<br><br>
    The 'Start time' begins to run if you move the cursor to the 'RST rcvd'
    field. This means that you can set your RST without any hurry. Also,
    the QSO duration counter starts to run. It is just behind the time
    fields on the logging screen.<br><br>
    If the cursor leaves the 'Call' field, a lot of another details are
    displayed. If the location is exactly on an island with IOTA reference
    number, it is displayed in the IOTA field. If the call represents more
    IOTA refs., the IOTA designator above its field became red. Click the
    button on the right side and a pull-down menu with all possible IOTA
    references is displayed.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h26.png" border="0"><br><br>
    CQRLOG also displays the usual data like exact QTH description
    (including province, regions, call districts etc.), WAZ and ITU zones,
    continent, DXCC reference, geographical coordinates (in decimal form),
    distance, azimuth (direction), date and local time of the target point
    and the salutation corresponding to the local time (GM, GE etc.). <br><br>
    <b>Contest section</b> in NewQSO window is for <b>editing logged qsos, not for entering contest qsos</b>.
    <i> This part is only visible if contest window is active.</i><br><br>
    
    
    You can add a general long note to your log with the Ctrl-N key (from
    the logging screen or from the 'File' menu option).<br><br>
    <img src="img/h2.png" border="0"><br><br>
    Ctrl-N opens a new dialog window where you can add or edit your note.
    This note is <b>not</b> related to any record, it is just a notepad allowing
    operations with your notes which are stored in your log database.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h68.png" border="0"><br><br>
    If you check <b>Preferences/New QSO/Enable satellite mode</b> you get a new tab where 
    you can enter satellite name, rx frequency and propagation mode.
    There are several propagation modes that you can select, not only "SAT" so this 
    is usefull also when keeping record of non satellite contacts.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h120.png" border="0"><br><br>
    If a call sign is entered, the grayline map displays a line from your QTH to
    the target point.<br><br>

<img src="img/h24.png" border="0"><br><br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img src="img/note.png"></td>
        <td bgcolor="#eaeaea"><strong>
            <font color="blue">Note: </font></strong>
            The yellow line on the grayline map has nothing to do with actual beam
            heading nor the actual path! The purpose of this line is to indicate if
            the path goes from/to day or night areas.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>

<br>
<div align="justify"><strong><h3>Status line</h3></strong>
    <img src="img/h44.png" border="0"><br><br>
    Here your own QRA locator is displayed which can be changed using Ctrl-L (important
    mostly for VHF freaks who forget to change the QRA locator in the QTH profile).
    In the next column is the reference call sign (the core of a slashed call, ie.
    KH6/OK2CQR). You can change it using Ctrl-R. The purpose is to provide the possibility
    of changeing the reference call if a correction of membership needed.
    The number in the right corner denotes the CQRLOG version.
    <p align=center><img src=img/line.png></p>
    <a name="ah18"><h2><strong>New QSO (offline logging, ie. from paper log etc.)</strong></h2></a>
    To switch to the offline mode, check the 'Offline' box above the date.
    To indicate that you are offline, the box with the 'Offline'
    description became red framed.<br><br>
    <img src="img/h30.png" border="0"><br><br>
    Basically, offline logging is the same as online logging, however
    there are some differences. The 'Frequency' and 'Mode' fields are not
    skipped. You can enter the exact frequency or choose a default (for
    each band) from the pull-down menu. The same applies to the mode.<br><br>
    You also need to enter the 'Date' and at least the 'Start time'. The
    date format is YYYYMMDD and you can enter it without dashes, ex. 26.
    May 1994 can be entered as just 19940526. The dashes are added
    automatically. The same applies to the time which can be entered
    without the colon.<br><br>
    The CAT (radio computer control) is turned off. Other fields and log
    actions are the same. If you uncheck the 'Offline' box, CQRLOG returns
    to the online mode.<br><br></div>

<a name="ah33"><h2><strong>Digital modes </strong></h2></a>
CQRLOG employs <em>fldigi</em> by Dave Freese, W1HKJ and <em>WSJT-X</em> by Joe Taylor, K1JT. We believe that these are the
best digimode softwares available.<br>
<br>The most important thing is a <a href="h1.html#ch2">proper setup</a> of the remote mode. For <em>fldigi<em> you have 2 different ways to setup remote .<br>
For <em>wsjt-x</em>, setup is done at same tab of preferences as <em>fldigi<em>. For operating with wsjt-x see: <a href="wsjt.html">Wsjt-x operation</a>
<br><br> To use <em>fldigi</em>, CQRLOG must be switched to Remote from the menu File -> Remote mode for fldigi(or CTRL+M).
<br> To use <em>wsjt-x</em>, CQRLOG must be switched to Remote from the menu File -> Remote mode for wsjt.
<br> To use <em>N1MM logger</em>, CQRLOG must be switched to Remote from the menu File -> Remote mode for N1MM logger.<br><br>
<img src="img/h104.png"><br><br>
The logging screen changes to indicate that CQRLOG is now working in 'Remote mode!' and
can be controlled either from <em>fldigi</em> or can "dictate" the mode and frequency
and <em>fldigi</em> now serves as the remote input device.
<br> With wsjt-x the text 'Wsjtx remote ' includes also last received datagrams number and changes color in every receive to easily see that UDP link is alive between cqrlog and wsjt-x.
<br><br>
<img src="img/h103.png"><br><br>
Now, use <em>fldigi</em> in its normal way and your contacts will go directly to CQRLOG.
