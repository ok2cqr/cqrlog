            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

<h2><strong>Start and stop scripts</strong></h2><p>

     "Run at cqrlog start" and "Run at cqrlog stop" calls to scripts:</br>
      ~/.config/cqrlog/start.sh</br>
     ~/.config/cqrlog/stop.sh</br></p><p>
     They are called when program is up/goes down and rigctld is still running.
     You can do anything with them. </br>
     If you have PC controlled relay box you can  start  your coffee maker when cqrlog starts and when cqlog is closed
     switch coffee maker off  :D :D :D</br>
     If you have rotctld yuo can turn your antenna to start direction.
     With rigctld you can power your rig, or/and set your favorite frequency and mode when cqrlog starts.
     </br>At cqrlog closing phase 1000ms (1sec) wait time is added so that script can access to rigctld before it goes down.
     This should be enough to execute a command.<br>
     Some examples for script with rigctld commands (for more consult "man rigctld"):</br><pre>
     ---------------------------------------------
     #!/bin/bash
     # remove # from beginning of line you want to take in use:
     #echo -n -e '\x87'0 |  nc localhost 4532 #Turns rig power OFF
     #echo -n -e '\x87'1 |  nc localhost 4532 #Turns rig power ON
     #echo -n -e '\x87'2 |  nc localhost 4532 #Turns rig power STANDBY
     #echo -n -e F 3510000 |  nc localhost 4532 # Set frequency to 3.510Mhz
     #echo -n -e M USB 0 |  nc localhost 4532 #Set mode USB with default filter width
     #echo -n -e M CW 500 |  nc localhost 4532 #Set mode CW with 500Hz filter (must be installed)
     exit
     ---------------------------------------------
     </pre>
     For stop.sh it is just a copy of start.sh with different lines selected (# removed from start)
     </br>
     Remember to chmod a+x start.sh and stop.sh to make them execute for all.
     </p><p> NOTE: Your rig may not start with rigctld power-on command if it is totally powered of (CPU is not running). 
     </br>In that case try to set it to stand by-state at closing time. Then it may start again with power-on command.
