            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

TRX Control window shows current frequency and buttons that allow change of band, mode, memory and rig. 
<br>Additional selections are User defined buttons, Power buttons, Vfo A and B buttons and memory information field.
<br>When pressing band selection button rig moves to that band using predefined frequency of currently active mode. Default frequencies and User buttons can be defined in <a href="h1.html#ah7">preferecences/TRX control</a>.
<br><br>
By clicking frequency display you can set a new frequency and click again (or press enter) to send command to rig.
<br>You can also use mouse roll to move frequency after first clicking the frequency display. 

<ul><li>By default steps are 100Hz 
</li><li>Keeping <strong>Shift key</strong> pressed while turning the roll steps are 1kHz
</li><li>Keeping <strong>Ctrl key</strong> pressed while turning the roll steps are 10kHz
</li><li>Keeping both <strong>Shift key</strong> and <strong>Ctrl key</strong> pressed while turning the roll steps are 1MHz
</li></ul>
You can select rig vfo with buttons <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> but there may be no feedback what vfo is currenty used (Icom brand rigs do not support "Get_vfo" command).
</p><a name="m4"></a><p>If <strong>M_up</strong> or <strong>M_dwn</strong> are pressed or memory is selected by double click of memory list, the information text will show up to <strong>Mem Info</strong> field. If frequency is changed manually after that info text will disappear.
<br>If memory does not have info text (max 25chr) just <strong>x of y</strong> is displayed where x refers to memory order in Add/Modify memory list and y total amount of memories.
<strong>None</strong> (in red) indicates that there are no memory lines.
<br>With <strong>P-on/off/stb</strong> buttons current rig can be set ON, OFF or STANDBY (if it supports rigctld power commands).
<br>Default setting for power buttons is hidden. You can change it via dropdown menu "Preferences". They are also hidden if rig can not support power commands.
<br><br><strong>M_up</strong> and <strong>M_dwn</strong> buttons select next/previous entry from memory list. <strong>M_Wri</strong> adds entry to memory list from current rig frequency and mode and info field shows<strong> "MW ok"</strong>.
<br><br>You can change rig frequency by clicking frequency display. Then you can enter a new <strong>MHz value</strong> and press enter.
<br>You can also use mouse wheel to change frequency. One wheel step is 100Hz, Keeping <strong>Shift key</strong> pressed the step is 1kHz. Keeping <strong>Ctrl key</strong> pressed the step is 10kHz.
Keeping both keys pressed the step is 1MHz.
<br>If you use mouse wheel the rig frequency is changed while turning. There is no need to press enter then. Just move mouse cursor away from frequency display.

<ul><li><strong>NOTE: </strong>Check <strong>pereferences/TRXcontrol/Switch only between mode related memories</strong><br>Cqrlog TRXcontrol memories are categorized by mode (groups). CW, SSB(=AM+USB+LSB+FM), RTTY(=RTTY+DATA+PKTLSB+PKTUSB+PKTFM)[no mode selector for PKT*  but you may "M wri" them anyway]. 
So do not wonder if you get smaller amount of memories than in your list when pressing <strong>M_up</strong> and <strong>M_dwn</strong> with "Show mode related" checked.

<br>You can <b>search a memory</b> by clicking the first (header) line of grid. Search is done against the column you clicked.
<br>You can set rig by double click of an memory row in <strong>Open  memory list</strong>. Similar action happen also in <strong>Add/Modify memories</strong>. The differense is that you can keep
 <strong>Open memory list</strong> open while loggeing qsos etc. Where as <strong>Add/Modify memories</strong>, when open, blocks other functionality.
 <br>While <strong>Add/Modify memories</strong> is open you can use buttons in right frame. Texts of buttons are quite self explaining.
 <br>Deleting a memory line, or all lines, do not have any further warning questions (Are you sure?). In case you deleted something wrong just close window with  <strong>Cancel</strong>. No changes are recorded then.
<br>Closing <strong>Add/Modify memories</strong> is done with buttons <strong>OK</strong> or <strong>Cancel</strong>. Closing <strong> Open memory list</strong> window must be done using <strong>x</strong> at top right corner of window.
<br> <strong> Open memory list</strong> closes also if <strong>Add/Modify memories</strong> is opened. They can not be open at same time.
<br><br> If you make changes to <strong>preferences/TRXControl</strong> after that just select another radio (even if not existing) from radio buttons <strong>Radio 1</strong> , <strong>Radio 2</strong>. Then select back the previous radio and new values are read. It is possible also reload settings from <strong>NewQSO/File/Refresh TRX/ROT control</strong>.</p>

<p>

From NewQSO/Window you can open <strong>Rotor control</strong> window.

</p>
Window shows current position of rotor with <strong>numerical display, Short and Long path Buttons and radio buttons to select rotor 1 or rotor 2</strong>.
<br>User can resize window and select <strong>additional bar display, direction and stop buttons</strong>.
<br>Small numbers on top of bar display shows current rotor limits. Usually this is 0..360, but may be also -180..180 depending on rotor model, or other user defined limits.
<br>Direction drive buttons run rotor until stop button is pressed or maximum 15sec time limit is reached.
<br><br> When a call is entered to <strong>NewQSO</strong> callsign field and cursor is moved away from that field <strong>DXCC info</strong> part gets filled against call prefix and/or locator grid,
 then, when <strong>DXCC/AZIM</strong> shows a value, it is possible to press <strong>Short Path</strong> or <strong>Long Path buttons</strong> and your ro
 tor will turn your antenna to that direction.
<br><br>It is also possible to set new direction by a click on <strong>Azimuth display</strong>, type a new direction value and press <strong>Enter</strong> or use  <strong>mouse wheel</strong> to select degrees.
<br>One wheel step is one degree. If you keep <strong>Shift key</strong> pressed while turning mouse wheel the step will be 10 degrees. If <strong> Ctrl key</strong> is pressed instead step will be 100 degrees.
<br>If you have used mouse wheel it is enough to move mouse away from Azimuth reading to get rotor turning. No enter keypress is needed then.
<br><br>Pressing <strong>Stop button</strong> stops rotor turning started either with path or turn buttons.</p>
<p>Progress bar displays Az value relative to AzLimits (if Use \dump_state is checked in preferences) so do not wonder if it in some cases may look different than numerical true direction display. 
<br>If error message is received from rotctld button area turns red. If requested turn command is ok, but az_min or az_maz limits change requested direction from true direction 
(then antenna may not always reach requested direction) button area will turn yellow as warning sign.
<br>The length of color flash depends on poll rate and is error permanent or not.
<br>
<br>If you make changes to <strong>preferences/Rot Control</strong> after that just select another rotor (even if not existing) from radio buttons <strong>Rotor 1</strong> , <strong>Rotor 2</strong>. Then select back the previous rotor and new values are read. It is possible also reload settings from <strong>
NewQSO/File/Refresh TRX/ROT control</strong>.</p>
