            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

TRX Control window Shows current frequency and buttons allow change of Band, mode, memory and rig.
<br><br>You can select rig vfo with buttons <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> but there is no feedback what vfo is currenty used as Icom brand rigs do not support "Get_vfo" command.
</p><p>If <b>M_up</b> or <b>M_dwn</b> are pressed or memory is selected by double click of memory list, the information text will show up to <b>Mem Info</b> field. If frequency is changed manually after that info text will disappear.
<br>If memory does not have info text (max 25chr) just <b>x of y</b> is displayed where x refers to memory order in Add/Modify memory list and y total amount of memories.
<b>None</b> (in red) indicates that there are no memory lines.
<br>With <b>P-on/off/stb</b> buttons current rig can be set ON, OFF or STANDBY (if it supports rigctld power commands).
<br>Default setting for power buttons is hidden. You can change it via dropdown menu "Preferences".
<br><br><b>M_up</b> and <b>M_dwn</b> buttons select next/previous entry from memory list. <b>M_Wri</b> adds entry to memory list from current rig frequency and mode and info field shows<b> "MW ok"</b>.
<br>
<br><br><b>NOTE!!!</b> <br>Check <b>pereferences/TRXcontrol/Switch only between mode related memories</b><br>Cqrlog TRXcontrol memories are categorized by mode (groups). CW, SSB(=AM+USB+LSB+FM), RTTY(=RTTY+DATA+PKTLSB+PKTUSB+PKTFM)[no mode selector for PKT*  but you may "M wri" them anyway]. 
So do not wonder if you get smaller amount of memories than in your list when pressing <b>M_up</b> and <b>M_dwn</b> with "Show mode related" checked.

<br>You can set rig by double click of an memory row in <b>Open  memory list</b>. Similar action happen also in <b>Add/Modify memories</b>. The differense is that you can keep
 <b>Open memory list</b> open while loggeing qsos etc. Where as <b>Add/Modify memories</b>, when open, blocks other functionality.
 <br>While <b>Add/Modify memories</b> is open you can use buttons in right frame. Texts of buttons are quite self explaining.
 <br>Deleting a memory line, or all lines, do not have any further warning questions (Are you sure?). In case you deleted something wrong just close window with  <b>Cancel</b>. No changes are recorded then.
<br>Closing <b>Add/Modify memories</b> is done with buttons <b>OK</b> or <b>Cancel</b>. Closing <b> Open memory list</b> window must be done using <b>x</b> at top right corner of window.
<br> <b> Open memory list</b> closes also if <b>Add/Modify memories</b> is opened. They can not be open at same time.
<br><br> If you make changes to <b>preferences/TRXControl</b> after that just select another radio (even if not existing) from radio buttons <b>Radio 1</b> , <b>Radio 2</b>. Then select back the previous radio and new values are read. It is possible also reload settings from <b>NewQSO/File/Refresh TRX/ROT control</b>.</p>

</p>
Window shows current position of rotor, Buttons to set Short/Long path direction and radio buttons to select rotor 1 or rotor 2.
<br><br> When you have filled a call to NewQSO callsign field and moved away from that field DXCC info part is filled against call prefix, and/or locator grid if entered.
 At that point, when DXCC/AZIM shows a value it is possible to press <b>Short Path</b> or <b>Long Path buttons</b> and your rotator will turn your antenna to that direction.
<br>Pressing <b>Stop button</b> stops rotator turning.</p>
<p>If error message is received from rotctld button box turns red. If requested turn command is ok, but az_min or az_maz limits prevent antenna to reach requested direction button box will turn yellow. The length of color flash depends poll rate and is error permanent or not.
<br>
<br>If you make changes to <b>preferences/Rot Control</b> after that just select another rotator (even if not existing) from radio buttons <b>Rotor 1</b> , <b>Rotor 2</b>. Then select back the previous rotor and new values are read. It is possible also reload settings from <b>NewQSO/File/Refresh TRX/ROT control</b>.</p>
