<a name="ah19"><h2><strong>DX Cluster Operation</strong></h2></a>
<img src="img/h4.png" border="0"><br><br>
There are two basic options - web cluster and the usual DX cluster with
telnet options. The <b>web cluster</b> method is <b>good for monitoring</b>. There is no
internal node setup, <b>you can not spot</b>. CQRLOG downloads the spots at
regular intervals, the interval is fixed and cannot be changed.
<br><br>Telnet cluster is <b>fully featured</b>. You can also set up your
preferences on the node. The Command line box is used for all commands,
settings etc. with one exception - the Tilde key (~) is used for spotting.
The color coding and spot filtering is set up in the
<a href="h1.html#ah11"><b>Preferences menu</b></a>. <strong>Connect</strong> to the
Cluster node by simply clicking the 'Connect' button. You should see the cluster node
messages indicating progress. You can enter any command into the 'Command' field
(ie. SH/DX to display last spots, SH/U to see the users connected to the node etc.).
<br><br><img src="img/h4f.png" border="0"><br><br>
When Telnet connection is active the "F-keys" tab becomes visible. There you can define 10 commands to be sent to DXCluster by pressing corresponding
<b>F1 -F10 key while keeping also Shift key pressed</b>.
<br>
<br> Double click with mouse left on DX spot line applies DX callsign to NewQSO and sets rig frequency to spot QRG.
 If you have checked <b>NewQSO/Auto</b> checkbox and set mode frequencies at <b>preferences/bands/frequencies</b> also right mode will be set to rig.
<br>If there is additional info available on spot line it is copied to clipboard. You can set cursor to desired NewQSO field and apply info from clipboard with Ctrl-V.
 That is an easy and quick way to store IOTA, SOTA, WWFF or other info from DX spot line to qso record.
<br>This works with normal spots starting with "DX de" and also from lines printed by "sh/dx" command.


</p><img src="img/h4b.png" border="0"> <img src="img/h4c.png" border="0"><br><p>
With <b>Ctrl-W</b> you can send a spot to DXCluster if you are connected. If NewQSO is empty the spot is generated from last logged call from current log. 
If there is a call entered in NewQSO/Call field NewQSO information will be used for spot generation.
Additionally you can add used Mode and RST sent by pressing button <b>+Mode_Rst</b> and/or add locators by pressing button <b>+Locators
</b>. Locator separators <b>&lt;&gt;</b> will have propagation mode included if it is set from <b>NewQSO/Satellite/Propagation</b>.
<br> <b>+UsrMsg</b> adds user defined message.
<br>User message can be generated with <b>right</b> mouse click to button. Same predefined macros as in <a href="h26.html#predef"><b>cw messages</b></a> can be used.
<br>Moving mouse cursor over button a hint will show the text what is added by pressing button.
<br><br><b>Note!</b> There is a limited space to spot info. User string generation warns you about long message, but it is up to you to decide.
<br>You must cancel spot sending and reopen it with Ctrl-W to get User message up to date after editing it.
<br>
<br>Strings can be added only once. To edit or delete added strings you must use keyboard's delete button. When spot looks good <b>press enter</b> or click button <b>OK</b> and spot will be sent to connected DXCluster.
<br><br>
With <b>Ctrl-Z</b> you can scroll back 5 last used DXCluster commands. It is very handy if you make error
 in cluster command. You do not have to retype everything, just Ctrl-Z and then fix the command and send it again.
<br><br> With <b>Ctrl-S</b> you can save the DXCluster command that you have typed, but not yet sent to dxcluster.
 Command disappears from "command"-line and is saved as StartConnectionCommand. It will be sent to dxcluster as
 first command after connection is established. You can set it for example sh/dx 50 to get your Bandmap
 populated right away when connected.
 <br>You can type this command to "command"-line and save it with Ctrl-S when you are not connected, but it will be saved also when you are connected to DXCluster (then it is not sent to DXCluster, just saved).
<br>To remove saved StartConnectionCommand just press Ctrl-S when "command"-line is empty.
<br> This command can be set also via <a href="h1.html#ah11"><b>Preferences/DXCluster</b></a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="m40">Callsign Alert</a></h3>
<p><img src="img/misc40.png" name="40"  width="458" height="388">
</img>
<br><br>Callsign alert is enabled from dialog that opens pressing DXCluster window's "preferences"-button. For setting up the alert itself see 
<a href=h1.html#ah11>Preferences/DXCluster</a>. From same dialog as setting up alert also the list of alerted callsigns opens.
</p><img src="img/misc41.png" name="41"  width="458" height="388">
</img>
<img src="img/misc42.png" name="42"  width="300" height="200">
</img>
<p>
Callsign alert window allows <b>adding</b>, <b>deleting</b> and <b>editing</b> callsigns that should activate the alarm.
<br>Usage is quite straight: just add all new callsigns you want to alert. For more specific alerts set also band and mode that you want to produce the alarm.
</p>
<img src="img/misc43.png" name="43"  width="380" height="260">
</img>
<img src="img/misc44.png" name="44"  width="380" height="260">
</img>
<p>
There is also checkbox "<b>Allow partialy callsign alert</b>" that allows many different kind of alerting conditions using regular expressions (regexp).
<br>As an example from the image of callsign alert window you can see different regexp variations for some alert conditions. 
<br>In order they will alert as follows:
<br>
<li> calls having numbers 1,2 or 3  @30M/all mode</li>
<li> calls having number 4 @40M/SSB</li>
<li> calls having number 6 @40M/CW</li>
<li> calls having numbers 7 or 9 @17M/SSB</li>
<li> all calls @2M/all mode</li>
<li> calls starting with EA @40M/RTTY</li>
<li> calls starting with VK @all bands/all modes</li>
<li> calls starting with XF1IM basicly this is whole call, but can have also suffix extensios like /M /P etc all bands/all modes</li>
<li> calls starting with ZL all bands/all modes</li>
<br>
For more information how to use regexp delimiters see: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended</a>

<h3><a name="m4"></a>DXCluster Chat</h3>
<p><img src="img/misc12.png" name="12"  width="458" height="388">
</img>
<br>

</p>
<br/>DXCluster window has now “overlay” as chat RX window. All lines that begins with “YOURCALL DE”, but do not end to cluster prompt “&gt;” are copied to this window.<br/>
Time(your local PC time) and caller’s call are added in from of text line. This works only in Telnet session, not Web session<br/>
No more lost chats that are run over with the flood of DxSpots while you are visiting kitchen to get a cup of coffee. DXChat uses the call you have used for logging in to DXCluster (that can be different as your current log settings call).</p>
<p><img src="img/misc14.png" name="14"  width="362" height="307">
</img>
<br/>The size of Chat window, relative to Dx spot window can be adjusted pressing first button “Preferences” and then selecting “Chat size” from there. After doing that “Command:”-cell  at bottom of window is replaced with size slider.<br/>
<img src="img/misc13.png" name="13"  width="209" height="121">
</img>
<br/>Pressing the slider knob with mouse-left button and moving slider will reduce the size of  chat window. When mouse button is released “Command:”-cell returns and Chat window remains selected size.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0066">If you have never used Chat window before default size </font><font color="#ff0066">will be </font><font color="#ff0066">2 (=invisible)</font>.<br/>
Resize via “preferences”-button if you want to see it. <br/>
If you do not like this Chat window you can move/leave it to minimum size (2). Then it takes just horizontal 2px amount from DXSpot window.</p>
<p>While minimized to up Chat window still receives all lines addressed to your logon call (and not having  “&gt;”-prompt at the end of line).<br/>
So any time you like you can make it larger and chat lines are there to check.</p>

        <td valign="top">
            <div align="justify"><br><br><br><br>
                The main purpose of a bandmap is to combine the most interesting info from two sources - the DX
                Cluster and your personal notes. The bandmap combines a DX Cluster window with scratch
                pad memories available on many radios, however a band map is more comfortable by far - you
                don't need to manipulate subtle buttons on the radio panel, also the transceiver does
                not indicate what is in the scratch pad memory. The band map is operated from the keyboard
                and shows all at a glance.
                <br><br>A valuable addition is the 'entries aging' option. If the bandmap entry is 'too' old,
                it changes color and after another period it disappears. This is different from the usual
                DX Cluster windows which display details of stations you have already worked, that are QRT
                or are not very interesting to you from another reason. A band map provides frequency-sorted
                and highly filtered details which don't scroll away (like the DX Cluster window does).
                There are two levels of filtering:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Spot filtering set up for the DX Cluster window</li>
                <li>Additional band map filtering capable of filtering out spots from momentarily unwanted
                    modes, contries, zones or continents. CQRLOG has another filter allowing you to watch spots
                    of special interest, ie. you are waiting for an expedition etc. You can set up another
                    filter showing spots only on the active band (the band which the radio is on) and the
                    actual mode (the mode the radio is on).</li>
                <li> From filtering window you can also set width for frequency and call columns. After change clear is needed to get all lines to have even columns.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div align="justify">You can add your own information by writing the call into the logging
                screen in the usual way (like logging). Then press <strong>Ctrl-A</strong> and the entry
                will be added to the band map. Your own entries are marked with an asterisk (here MD0CCE).
                You can return to the frequency anytime, the call will jump into its box in the same way
                as if clicked from the DX Cluster window. Click on any entry, you are on, prepared for
                QSO logging.<br><br>
                If the entry becomes older than the set time, it is displayed in a lighter color. Very old
                entries will disappear, also if you log the station, the corresponding entry disappears
                from the band map. 
                <br><br>The entries are always sorted by frequency. Default order is for lowest to higest. This can be reversed with checkbox <b>Reverese order</b>.
                <br>With normal order and <b>Show active band</b> checked this shows CW spots first (CW is normally at band low edge). Cheking <b>Reverse order</b> will then show SBB spots first.
                <br><br>When band map form is active new spots are not added. This helps to locate needed
                line from all spot lines. Form name changes to <b>BM PAUSED!</b> to remind that nothing will be
                 added until focus is moved to any other form by a mouse click.
