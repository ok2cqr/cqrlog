<strong><h3>Description:</h3></strong>
<div align="justify">
    <div>CQRLOG is an advanced ham radio logging application based
        on a MySQL database. It provides radio interfacing utilizing the hamlib libraries
        (currently support for 140+ radio types and models), DX cluster
        connection, band map, QRZ.com/HamQTH.com callbook (XML access),
        ClubLog and Logbook of the World support, IOTA support, a
        grayliner, propagation indicator, xplanet support (maps in azimuthal projection centered in
        your QTH), OK1RR free QSL manager database etc.
        <br> <br>CQRLOG is intended mainly for seriously HF DX minded operators
        but can be used for any ham logging purpose, also by casual operators.
        It is equipped with probably most accurate DXCC country database
        available, providing not only the country resolution but also state,
        province, region, district etc. It resolves also antarctic bases,
        special event stations, contest callsigns and much more.<br><br>
        CQRLOG has its own web site at
        <a href=http://www.cqrlog.com><strong>http://www.cqrlog.com</strong></a>.
        Find news, changes, latest additional files and howtos there.
        If you have a problem, browse the web site first, then ask for help.

    <br><br><strong><h3>Supported transceivers:</h3>
</strong> The Radio Control interface is provided using <i>hamlib</i>,
    a set of libraries, which is a development effort to provide a
    consistent interface for programmers wanting to incorporate radio
    control in their programs. <i>hamlib</i> is not a complete user
    application, rather, it is a software layer intended to make
    controlling various radios and other shack hardware much easier.
    <br><br> Most recent amateur radio transceivers allow external control
    of their functions through a serial interface. Unfortunately, control
    commands are not always consistent across a manufacturer's product line
    and each manufacturer's product line differs greatly from its
    competitors.
    <br><br> There's no standardized protocol to remotely control one's
    rig, be it a Ham radio transceiver, a SWL receiver, any kind of scanner
    or other mobiles. However, many manufacturer have designed their
    own proprietary protocol, implemented in some of their product family.
    Therefore, each rig family will require a <i>hamlib</i> backend to set
    the VFO frequency, change mode and passband width, get current signal
    strength, etc. The actual list of supported radios can be found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hamlib/wiki/Supported%20Radios/"><strong>on Hamlib website</strong></a>.
    <br><br> <strong><h3>Installation:</h3></strong>
    Ubuntu users can use a repository on <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ok2cqr/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">Launchpad</a>. To add the repo, open a terminal and copy&amp;paste<br><br>
    <code>
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ok2cqr/ppa<br>
        sudo apt-get update<br>
        sudo apt-get install cqrlog <br>
    </code><br>
    Only Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 are officially supported but there are also builds for other
    versions of Ubuntu on <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ok2cqr/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">Launchpad</a>.
    <br><br>
    Debian users can simply install using the package manager<br><br>
    <code>
        sudo apt-get install cqrlog <br>
    </code><br><br>
    For other distributions, you can use binaries located at
    <a href="http://cqrlog.com/download">http://cqrlog.com/download</a>.
    Some of them, like Fedora and Arch, have their own repositories for CQRLOG - Fedora: <a
        href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/cqrlog">https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/cqrlog</a>
    ArchLinux <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cqrlog/">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cqrlog/</a><br>
    If upgrading, no important file will be overwritten. Anyway, <strong>backup your log</strong> before you begin any
    upgrade!
    <br><br><strong><h3>Dependencies:</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HamLib</strong> - must be installed even if you don't want radio control. The sources are available
            at <a href="http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/"><strong>http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/</strong></a>, however
            precompiled packages are available for almost all major Linux distributions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>MySQL server and client</strong> - The MySQL client must be installed,
            without this the program will not work at all. A MySQL server must be reachable,
            either on the local machine or via a network.
        </li>
        <li><strong>libssl-devel</strong> needed if you want to use LoTW and/or online log upload
    </ul>
</div>

<strong><h3>Third Party Programs</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hamlib</strong> - <strong><font color="#FF0000">NEEDED</font></strong>,
        without this CQRLOG will not work!
    </li>
    <li><strong>Trusted QSL</strong> - for LoTW operations. Ubuntu and Debian have this package in their repositories.</li>
    <li><strong>xplanet</strong> - for DX Cluster spot visualization on the azimuthal map.</li>
    <li><strong>cwdaemon</strong> - for CW operation, only if you choose parallel or serial port keying without Winkey.
    </li>

                cwdaemon use may result in <strong>sloppy CW at speeds above 30 WPM</strong>.
                Use Winkey (by K1EL) if possible or your <strong>kernel must be modified to minimalize the
                    latency</strong>. Tickless, high resolution timer and 1000 Hz sampling rate must be used.
                Recommended for very experienced linux users only!
