10.3.2017 started  to move additions from 1.9.0

 -You may find some help from this file. It is for 1.9.0 version and has "too much" for this 2.0.4

 -moved wsjtx cq monitor
  
  If you want to start qso by double clicking callsign at wsjt-x CQ monitor you have to set
  "Accept UDP requests" in tab "Reporting" at wsjt-x's configuration settings.
 
  Monitor has alert function. For that you need to make script that can do almost anything for alerting! 
  
  Setting audio alert play.
  You need separate soundcard for wsjt-x and other for alerts. 1st might be inside
  the PC 2nd may be your inside your rig or some kind of USB sound card (ham digi interface).

  Move voice_alert.sh and wav files to ~/.config/cqrlog/voice_keyer  directory
  Make sure you have 'aplay' installed.
  Otherwise modify  voice_alert.sh to start your favorite player.
  
  ----------- voice_alert.sh -----start-------------------------
  #!/bin/bash
  # //audio file name (prefix) played on alert
  # //1.st parameter can be:
  #          'my'= answer to my cq,
  # //       'loc'=new main grid,
  # //       'text'=text found from line Ex. 'w c' on text field fits to "New country"
  # // create files you want to be played

  # This scirpt is seeking names with '.wav' suffix! Change if needed    

  #select audio card(if needed) and play alert message
  
  aplay ~/.config/cqrlog/voice_keyer/$1.wav
  ----------- voice_alert.sh -----end-------------------------

 
 -moved worked locators
 -moved propagation and renamed it to prop_DK0WCY to keep also original propagation

  --fixed CQmonitor alert. Triggers now only once per decoding round, not every line.
  --added modes qra64,iscat and msk144 to dUtils (now 42 modes)
 -moved CW keys because of PgUP/PgDN buttons are handy
  --messed up ac-list of offical propagation while adding dk0wcy. Fixed
  --dk0wxy and worked grids now keep their open/close status and positions during restart 
 -Worked_grids mode selector now fills selection list from dUtils.cmbMode

11.3.2017
 - removed "clearall" from wsjtx decode #5(logging) I think this losts qrz data. (altough it does not at v1.9.0!) (2.0.4(013))
 - Fixed #5 logging so that it does change edtcall (no refetch from web) if it is same as decoded call.
 - Fixed #5 logging so that if QRz locator is 6 char and the beginning is same as qsl locator the QRZ locator is keeped.(2.0.4(014))
 - Fixed small error in locator compare (2.0.4(015))
 - merged Petr's "sort by gridsqr" & "deleting comment" (2.0.4(016))
 - Fixed decode #2 (wsjtx status) so that if call does not change new QRZ fetch is not done. So you may add your own notes to NewQSO
   fields and they should remain there during #5( wsjtx logging) (2.0.4(017))
   
13.3.2017
 - Added two missing files fwkd.lrs and richmemo/richmemopackage.lrs that git has left out from transfer. Without them fetched
   source from github to fresh computer did not compile cqrlog.
   
   Also tested how to handle richmemo. With these it compiled ok:
   Then main screen of lazarus select "Package". From that menu select "Open package (.lpk)"
   With file browser dialog find richmemopackage.lpk from richmemo folder and select it.
   Package dialog opens.
   Try to compile with button "compile". If it goes ok, (now should with all files) Press "Use" button and select "Add to procect".
   
   Now cqrlog should compile ok. (Note! Terms of lazarus menus are translated from Finnish to English. I do not know original terms)  

 - Found bug in fMain.pas that allowed QSO edit while in wsjt-x remote causing error "Cannot focus disabled or invisible window".
   Now fixed and asks now to close remote mode before editing (as fldigi remote does, too).

14.3.2017
 - Returned (somehow, at some master version lost) function where disbling wsjt-x remote mode returns state of newQSO/Mode-AUTO selection.
   All needed code was there, but restoring part was removed from source(??).

   NOTE! This exist in original 2.0.4 too, I think ! (as I have not modified fMain.pas at this point when doing additions)
   
 - Merged upstream/master. Version change 2.0.5, within brackets still my build version (2.0.5(019))
 
15.3.2017

 - Added CQ monitor a function where asterisk *  is added CQ callers country code and printed in Fuchsia.
   This is to indicate that caller is calling directed CQ (DX, EU, AS, AF, OC, NA, SA etc.) and user should check that he is in dircected area
   before making answer to call.
   I.E. To answer 'CQ DX' you must be in DIFFERENT CONTINENT than caller.(2.0.5(020))

 - small bugfix (2.0.5(021))

 - seem to be hard to do... Addition to CQ monitor(2.0.5(020)) works when run inside lazarus, but not run from executive ?????
   lets see if this finally works. Otherwise "Houston we have problem..."(2.0.5(022))
   
16.3.2017

 - Stupid programmer makes stupid errors. All fuzz with directed CQ call was because part of code was inside debug execption.
   So it worked every time when run inside lazarus, or if started from terminal with debug=1. Fixed and should be ok now.

 - Fixed state of newQSO/Mode-AUTO selection return in case where program was closed with CQ monitor (wsjt-x remote) left on.
   Now returns previous state on next start when wsjt-x remote is not yet activated. We will not save remote mode over program
   restart.(2.0.5(023))
  
20.3.2017

 - Worked locator grid's selections "follow rig" and "show wkd only" are remembered over program restart.
 - Wsjtx Monitor selection "no history" and all alerting settings are remembered over program restart.
 - tmrWsjtx.Interval is decreased to 150ms. Affects UDP packet decoding.
   There is a situation where more speed is needed most:
   If monitor is started when wsjt-x itself has been running long time before it will send all decoded packets that are in 
   receive buffer (I.E. contets of "Band Activity" window of wsjt-x) during answer to ststus request wsjtx monitor is asking 
   to know what band and mode is in use.
   This also speeds up normal period decoding giving user more time (from that 10sec gap between periods) to decide to whose
   CQ call he is going to answer.

22.3.2017

 - modified NewQSO/Window listing to alpabethical order
 - added two selections "Reminder" and "Contest" and made forms and units for them. See CqrlogAdditions2.pdf for details.
   Tried to minimize changes to original cqrlog source code by doing these as separate units, but some modifications must 
   done inside original cqrlog source code to make these new ones to work.
   
   At same time I was thinking about moving wsjt-x decode inside of Wsjt-x monitor unit. It actually should be there.
   (maybe some day, maybe not...).

1.4.2017

 - added "No" checkbox to contest form. Changes tabulation order of  NRr,MSGr to MSGr,NRr for contest where there is just message
   but no number. Note that you can feed only numbers to NRs and NRr fields.
 
3.4.2017

 - returned Contest/Msg is Loc checkbox function to original meaning, I.E. when checked Msg is expected to be locator and placed 
   now ONLY to New/QSO/Grid field (not together with received rst).
 - added Contest/Tru checkbox for true reports exchange. Changes tabulation order so that it goes RSTs, RSTr, NRr, MSGr.
   This might be useful in VHF, UHF, SHF Tropo, Es etc. openings (and maybe some contests, too) where you like fast qso logging.

 - Added DXCluster additions.
  -- ACalls toggle button does just the same as "Preferences/DXCluster/List of callsigns" I.E. opens alert calls list for edit:
     This is easier and faster than using it via preferences. When edit list is closed alert remains active (button text is green)
     Second press deactivates alert (button text is black).
     Checkbox "Inc" changes alert to RegExp,so if any part of alert calls list fits to dx cluster's call it alerts.
     Unchecked call must be exactly same. I.E. "Inc" checked with list call OF100FI alerts OF100FI/1, OF100FI/2 ..etc.
  -- Typed command history. With Ctrl-Z you can scroll back 5 last commands (fix, if needed) and reuse them. (2.0.5(028))

11.04.2017

  - Added IP address field to preferences/fldigi-wsjtx settings of wsjt-x. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) but can be changed.
    There is no valid IP format check so you have to type right formatted address.
    This setting can be used if you run wsjt-x on different computer than cqrlog. If so, put the IP address of cqrlog computer
    to Wsjt-x's settings/reporting replacing there the default 127.0.0.1
    At cqrlog computer put cqrlog/preferences/wsjtx-settings IP address to the same as it's own network IP address. No need to change
    port numbers. Remember to open your firewalls on both computers to allow UDP traffic from 2237 port on your network.
    Tested with two laptops on same WiFi local network:
       cqrlog PC ip address 192.168.60.222, cqrlog setting/wsjt-x:  port 2237 address 192.168.60.222
       wsjt-x PC ip address 192.168.60.223, wstt-x setting/reporting  port 2237 address 192.168.60.222 
													(2.0.5(029))
20.04.2017

  - Changed contest form so that pressing 1xESC will return cursor to the end of previously typed callsign fro fixing. It also
    stops CW keying if it is initiated (as it does on NewQSO).
    New log seek (+qrz seek) is done again when leaving call field (tnx. note LA2FDA) 
    2xESC returns also to call field, but clears previously typed callsign completely (as it does in NewQso).
    This form is causing some focusing conflicts with NewQso form, but seems to work anyhow.
    Needs attention of better skilled programmer.   (2.0.5.(030))

22.04.2017

   - Fixed CQ Monitor so that it now shows also MSK144 cqs. Double click on callsign line does not initiate reply as it does with JT65/JT9
     I do not know should it with MSK144 mode, but I investigate it more in future and fix it if UDP specs have reply allowed when using MSK144.
     (2.0.5(31))

23.04.2017

   - Changed Wsjtx decoding timer so that when UDP packets are available timer turns to HiSpeed (50ms, const value). When no more
     Packets it turns to LoSpeed (1000ms).
     This helps in situation where wsjt-x has been on band for long and then carlog/remote wsjt-x is turned on. At that point wsjt-x
     will send all of it's buffered decodings at one go and there may be lots of old lines.
     It also speeds up things during noraml decode period (secs 50 - 60 of minute) giving user more time to decide to whos CQ he
     is going to answer.
     Merged also latest changes from Master_ok2cqr                   (2.0.5(032))

   - Small bugfix. tmrWsjtx was enabled after disableremotemode was called causing program exeption when wsjt-x was closed before cqrlog.
     (2.0.5(033))
