# TODOS
- Build the AppImage from the build and not from the installed source
- Add mariadb-server to the appimage
- Check it can work with CW-Keyers and USB/Serial devices
- Build latest hamlib from the sources before inclusion on the appimage
- Use latest lazarus/fpc from the sources before compiling the code [with libqt5pas1]
