  - changing of own locator didn't work in edit mode
  - ADIF import - QSOs on 12m band were ignored
  - callbook search in new QSO window tried to track down whole
    content of the callsign input box (e.g. KH6/OK2CQR instead of OK2CQR)
  - power stored in ADIF file included "W", which does not meet
    the ADIF specification.
