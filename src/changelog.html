    <ul style="list-style: square;text-align:left; color: green;" >
    <li>eQSL download: Fixed the stuck up caused by eQSL starting to add one more empty line at the end of downloaded file</li>
    <li>Contest: Inform remote mode 'on' when saving manual entered qso. Multimode contests like<br>
	NAC (CW,Phone,MGM) it may happen that remote is left on when jump from FT8 to CW/Phone.<br>
	Then entering qso manually looks like saved, but will never appear into log.	
    <li>Makefile: Clean fix (by Bill, WK2X)</li> 
    <li>Contest filter: If Contest window is open contest name is copied to filter</li>
    <li>(118)</li>

    <li>NewQSO: Details has new Tab 'Call statistic' After call entered shows wkd/L/E status on band grid</li>
    <li>RigControl: rigctld parameter '-C auto_power=1' is added only if user checks 'Rig pwr ON cmd' in TRXControl preferences.
    This should help old Hamlibs that claim auto_power is wrong parameter and refude to start</li>
    <li>NewQSO: Details Tab selected remembered even when satellite mode enabled</li>

    <li>Cabrillo export: Sets now suffix '.cbr' for filename as default</li>
    <li>(117)</li>
    <li>Preferences:TRXControl: Added checkbox 'compound poll' (default checked) When unchecked rig polling commands are sent each one on it's own line. This may help poor emulators like WFview.</li>
    <li>HamlibCW: Fixed StopSending procedure. Has now '+\stop_morse currVFO' that should work also other rigs than ts480 and Icoms and is implemented in rigctld at least from Jan2023</li> 
    <li>Callbook: CQRZCQ XML fixd and tested. Should be mostly ok now.</li>
    <li>Callbook: Added support to QRZCQ, not tested at all yet because of lack of premium account</li>
    <li>Preferences:TRXControl:#1 Dummy rig: Starting rigctld can be changed (was disabled) </li>
    <li>HamlibCW: Added checkbox to use Hamlib (past Jul-2023) 1k CW buffer.(Sends memory as string despite length)</li>

    <li>NewQSO:Fix:Keep propagation mode when 2xESC even when no qsos saved yet</li>
    <li>Preferences:NewQSO: Added default operator setting (if different that station callsign)</li>
    <li>Grayline: Show also rotor beam path if in use and selected</li>
    <li>ROT control: Fix: Remember used rotor (1 or 2) over Cqrlog restart.</li>
    <li>WSJTremote, Map mode: '*' appear fixed when line ends ' 73'</li> 
    <li>Preferences/TRXControl: Added checkbox 'Set UTC to Rig'. Uses rigctld '\set_clock' command on next full minute after rig initialization</li>	
    <li>WSJTremote, Map mode: '*' appeared when CQ-callers locator ended '73' (should appear only 'RR73' or ' 73' endings). Fixed</li>

    <li>Contest: pressing 'CQ start' moves focus to Call column</li>
    <li>Added hint texts to first start DB selection window</li>
    <li>Cabrillo export: Changed export to use time_off instead of time_on. 
    <br>With CW and Phone qsos this does not matter as times are usually same.
    <br>With FT8 qso takes longer and WSTX's (and N1MM's) exports are using time_off.
    <br>Now Cqrlog's export is equal to others.</li>
    <li>(116)</li>
    <li>Preferences: wsjt/fldigi: fixed hidden checkbox</li>
    <li>DXCluster: Added user defined command keys F1-F10 See help for details.</li>

    <li>Contest: counter HH:MM since last logged qso, QSO rate /10min and /1hour(these need testing)</li>	
    <li>Contest: Shift+ESC removes callsign (same as 3x ESC)</li>	
    <li>LoTW inport: changed date to be (today-1day) to be sure</li>	
    <li>LoTW Import: Checkbox to change Rcvd date to current date after successfull download (tu: 4X6GP)</li>	
    <li>When creating a new log it is now possible to copy configuration automated from existing log<br>
	(FYI: Configuration is log based)</li>
    <li>(115)</li>
    <li>Moved also solar data (propagation window) text address to user editable in preferences.</li>
    <li>Fixed solar data (propagation window) addresses from 'http' to 'https'</li>
    <li>Contest: Stores last used CQ frequency and mode when in Run. Click (or Ctrl+L) over reading resets rig to that freq+mode</li>

    <li>Clicking DXSpot line now sets wsjt std messages if wsjt-remote is active</li>
    <li>Rewritten DXCluster spot splitter because of faulty call grep</li>
    <li>Wsjtx remote:<br>
    Cqrlog will clear wsjt-x DXcall, DXgrid and StdMessages when band changes<br>
    HamQTH/QRZ info is now looked when Wsjtx/DXCall changes on RX and TX period<br>
    (Was before only on TX period)</li>
    <li>Contest window:<br>
    Fixed ESC key: 1x stops Cw sending, 2x returns cursor to Call column, 3x clears qso entry<br>
    Fixed F2 memory sending in S&amp;P mode when exit from Call column after callisgn was fixed (using 2xESC)<br>

	Should now respond better to true situation of current band</li> 
    <li>Removed one debug print from rigcontrol</li>	
    <li>(109)</li>
    <li>Fixed numkeypad in contest/callsign/gtk2, QT5 was already working</li>
    <li>RBNmonitor: Added source callsign filter</li>
    <li>Removed small change to "remove all upload triggers". No good<br>
	Instead added warnings for use with more than on online log</li>
    <li>(108)</li>
    <li>Very small change to "remove all upload triggers". Helps? </li>
    <li>Fixed startup rig power on with rig models below 10, mainly for mod #2</li>
    <li>Fixed Cabrillo export to have adjustable RST fields</li>
    <li>Fixed TAB key funtion in Contest window</li>
    <li>Added Contest/msg multipliers count and list by contest bands</li>
    <li>(107)</li>
    <li>Added cache write while preferences closing. Speeds up %50</li>
    <li>Added retry counter for rigctld connecting.</li>
    <li>Updated sat_names.tab (from Florian,DF2ET)</li>
    <li>Made Online logs Urls defineable</li>
    <li>Fix for DXCCRef edit/save. Now user changes are saved</li>
    <li>Fixed unwanted chars filter in contest/callsign that cause SQL error</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in "Fixed ver(104) bug where rig did not initialize"
    <li>Set default values for TRX and rotor port and poll</li>
    <li>Fixed some rig and rot parameter readings</li>
    <li>Fixed ver(104) bug where rig did not initialize if TRXControl window
        <br> stayed closed during Cqrlog start</li>
    <li>(105)</li>
    <li>Added macros:
	<br>%xnr - contest exchange serial number received
	<br>%xnrs- contest exchenge serial number received sends 9->N and 0->T
	<br>%xmr - contest exchange message received</li>
    <li>Fixed offline qso feed. When qso is saved returns to QsoDate column.
	<br>This makes qso manual feed from paper log easier as things start
	<br>from date and tabulation continues in chronological order:
	<br>date,start,end,call,freq, mode .. etc and when qso is saved
	<br>focus returns again to date column.    
	<br>When typing in Date and times in Offline Cqrlog will add punctuation
	<br>marks ('-' or ':') automatic. This way only number keys need to be typed.    
	<br>When not valid locator is entered (usually odd number of characters)
	<br>NewQSO/GRID label will turn bold red as warning sign when exit from
	<br>grid column.</li>
    <li>Added support for 1-6 rigs. User can define how many rigs he want to use
	<br>As before, only one rig can be active at time.
	<br>This change affects also mode/bandwidths settings and CW keyer settings.
	<br>All rigs can have their own settings for BW and CW keyer.</li>
    <li>Fix for quick split settings.
	<br>Fixed all edtboxes value limits to 0..9999. Fixed tabulation orders</li>
    <li>Added serial CW keyer commanding menu item.
	<br>Menuitem: NewQSO/File/Send hex bytes to keyer (W or K)
	<br>Item is visible with winkeyer or K3NG keyer and allows non text
	<br>hex bytes to be sent to serial line. </li>
    <li>Fix for contest name in contests that have all modes in use
	<br>CW/SSB/FM/MGM like NAC has.
	<br>Then MGM qsos coming from WSJT-X will get name from Cqrlog contest
	<br>name currently in contest window if it is open during remote.
	<br>This overwrites WSJT-X predefined 4 contest names making all
	<br>qsos in contest to have same contest name defined in contest window. </li>
    <li>Upgrade to Contest window
	<br>-Has now checkbox "S&P". When checked works as before.
	<br> When not checked launches memories F2,F3,F4 automated when
	<br> moving on columns.
	<br> F1 for sending CQ. Can be auto-repeated
	<br> F2 for sending call, rst and message
	<br> F3 for sending duplicate qso warning
	<br> F4 for sending after qso is logged with button or enter key
	<br>-Has now hint texts added. They can be turned off with checkbox.
	<br>-Has now status display to see how contest progress.
	<br>  procedure MWC will show OK1WC memorial status
	<br>  procedure NAC will show Nordic VUSHf activiy contest status
	<br>  Common status will show status of other (unspecified) contest statuses
	<br>  with user defined view.
	<br> More status procedures can be added later.
	<br>-Duplicate check will work now while typing in callsign. (before worked
	<br>     after cursor left callsign column)
	<br>-Added "Mark Dupe" checbox. When checked with duplicate check ON
	<br> saved dupicate qso is marked to "RST send" with "/D". It is operator's
	<br> duty to do something (or not) with this after Cabrillo log is produced.
	<br>
	<br>For more specific information see revised contest help file, please!</li>
    <li>Misc bug fixes.
	<br>-Changed Contest Filter to show contest names in order from A to Z (acs)
	<br>-Adjusted Contest Filter maxlines to default (8). This has effect when
	<br> QT5 widgets are used (shows more contest names at time).
	<br>-Fixed typo in Group edit field selector. Had "ŕ" in "operator"
	<br>-Fixed TRXControl's button "70cm". If no previous settings for 70cm
	<br> defaults were done loaded 80m band settings when pressed.
	<br>-Fixed double usage of query qBands. Preferences/bands/Frequencies list
	<br>loose it's grid contents if Wsjt-x remote is on (behind) and CQ-monitor selected.
	<br>-Updated help files</li>
        <li>WSJT-C CQ monitor shows US states
	<br>CQ-monitor checbox "USt" that allows USA states to monitored wsjt-CQs
	<br>When you check it at first time it suggests loading from fcc.gov it should
	<br>suggest same after 90 days of usage to update data.
	<br>US callsign=state (fcc_states.tab) file is over 10Mb and ist is loaded 
	<br>to RAM for runtime. Seeking a callsingn from there takes some time.</li>
    <li>RTTY mode is now DATA
	<br>At preferences/Modes you will see a new "DATA" that replaces the old "RTTY". 
	<br>Defaults for that are rig cmd:RTTY data mode:RTTY that acts like previous Cqrlogs.
	<br>Setting data mode affects DXSpots coloring and double clicking: You can set other
	<br>mode than RTTY to be used. </li>
    <li>Online log upload
	<br>Bottom of Preferences/Online log upload has some checkboxes to affect 
	<br>to online log upload. 
	<br>See help/Quick start/Online log upload support for more information. </li>
